# KeyboardAndMouseControl
 I selected the Espressif ESP32-S2-DevKitC-1 because it has two USB ports. But any microcontroller that can be made to work with a serial port on one USB port and a HID keyboard and mouse port on another USB port should work. I used Arduino 1.8.16, under Linux the compilation is very fast, but under Windows not so much. At this point in time, to get the S2 working I had to install the ESP32 beta V2.0 board version.
